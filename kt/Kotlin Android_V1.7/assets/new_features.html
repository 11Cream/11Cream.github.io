    <h1>Features Of Kotlin</h1>
    <p>Kotlin is a great fit for developing Android applications, bringing all of the advantages of
        a modern language to the Android platform without introducing any new restrictions:</p>

    <h3>Compatibility:</h3>
    <p>Kotlin is fully compatible with JDK 6, ensuring that Kotlin applications can run on older
        Android devices with no issues.</p>

    <h3>Performance:</h3>
    <p>A Kotlin application runs as fast as an equivalent Java one, thanks to very similar bytecode
        structure.</p>
    <h3>Interoperability:</h3>
    <p> Kotlin is 100% interoperable with Java, allowing to use all existing Android libraries in a
        Kotlin application.</p>
    <h3>Footprint:</h3>
    <p> Kotlin has a very compact runtime library, which can be further reduced through the use of
        ProGuard.</p>
    <h3>Compilation Time:</h3>
    <p>Kotlin supports efficient incremental compilation, so while there's some additional overhead
        for clean builds,
        incremental builds are usually as fast or faster than with Java.</p>
    <h3>Learning Curve:</h3>
    <p>For a Java developer, getting started with Kotlin is very easy. The automated Java to Kotlin
        converter included in the
        Kotlin plugin helps with the first steps.</p>
