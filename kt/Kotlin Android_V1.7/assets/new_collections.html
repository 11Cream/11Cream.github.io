    <h1 id="collections">Collections</h1>
    <p>Unlike many languages, Kotlin distinguishes between mutable and immutable
        collections (lists, sets, maps, etc). Precise control over exactly when
        collections can be edited is useful for eliminating bugs, and for designing good
        APIs.</p>
    <p>It is important to understand up front the difference between a read only <em>view</em>
        of a mutable collection, and an actually immutable collection. Both are easy to
        create, but the type system doesn't express the difference, so keeping track of
        that (if it's relevant) is up to you.</p>
    <p>The Kotlin <code>List&lt;out T&gt;</code> type is an interface that provides read
        only operations like <code>size</code>, <code>get</code> and so on. Like in
        Java, it inherits from <code>Collection&lt;T&gt;</code> and that in turn
        inherits from <code>Iterable&lt;T&gt;</code>. Methods that change the list are
        added by the <code>MutableList&lt;T&gt;</code> interface. This pattern holds
        also for <code>Set&lt;out T&gt;/MutableSet&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>Map&lt;K,
            out V&gt;/MutableMap&lt;K, V&gt;</code>.</p>
    <p>We can see basic usage of the list and set types below:</p>
    <pre><code class="code _highlighted" data-lang="text/x-kotlin">val numbers: MutableList&lt;Int&gt; = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3)
val readOnlyView: List&lt;Int&gt; = numbers
println(numbers)        // prints "[1, 2, 3]"
numbers.add(4)
println(readOnlyView)   // prints "[1, 2, 3, 4]"
readOnlyView.clear()    // -&gt; does not compile

val strings = hashSetOf("a", "b", "c", "c")
assert(strings.size == 3)
</code></pre>
    <p>Kotlin does not have dedicated syntax constructs for creating lists or sets. Use
        methods from the standard library, such as
        <code>listOf()</code>, <code>mutableListOf()</code>, <code>setOf()</code>,
        <code>mutableSetOf()</code>.
        Map creation in NOT performance-critical code can be accomplished with a simple
        idiom: <code>mapOf(a to b, c to
            d)</code></p>
    <p>Note that the <code>readOnlyView</code> variable points to the same list and
        changes as the underlying list changes. If the only references that exist to a
        list are of the read only variety, we can consider the collection fully
        immutable. A simple way to create such a collection is like this:</p>
    <pre><code class="code _highlighted" data-lang="text/x-kotlin">val items = listOf(1, 2, 3)
</code></pre>
    <p>Currently, the <code>listOf</code> method is implemented using an array list, but
        in future more memory-efficient fully immutable collection types could be
        returned that exploit the fact that they know they can't change.</p>
    <p>Note that the read only types are covariant.
        That means, you can take a <code>List&lt;Rectangle&gt;</code> and assign it to
        <code>List&lt;Shape&gt;</code> assuming Rectangle inherits from Shape. This
        wouldn't be allowed with the mutable collection types because it would allow for
        failures at runtime.</p>
    <p>Sometimes you want to return to the caller a snapshot of a collection at a
        particular point in time, one that's guaranteed to not change:</p>
    <pre><code class="code _highlighted" data-lang="text/x-kotlin">class Controller {
    private val _items = mutableListOf&lt;String&gt;()
    val items: List&lt;String&gt; get() = _items.toList()
}
</code></pre>
    <p>The <code>toList</code> extension method just duplicates the lists items, thus,
        the returned list is guaranteed to never change.</p>
    <p>There are various useful extension methods on lists and sets that are worth being
        familiar with:</p>
    <pre><code class="code _highlighted" data-lang="text/x-kotlin">val items = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4)
items.first() == 1
items.last() == 4
items.filter { it % 2 == 0 }   // returns [2, 4]

val rwList = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3)
rwList.requireNoNulls()        // returns [1, 2, 3]
if (rwList.none { it &gt; 6 }) println("No items above 6")  // prints "No items above 6"
val item = rwList.firstOrNull()
</code></pre>
    <p>â€¦ as well as all the utilities you would expect such as sort, zip, fold, reduce
        and so on.</p>
    <p>Maps follow the same pattern. They can be easily instantiated and accessed like
        this:</p>
    <pre><code class="code _highlighted" data-lang="text/x-kotlin">val readWriteMap = hashMapOf("foo" to 1, "bar" to 2)
println(readWriteMap["foo"])  // prints "1"
val snapshot: Map&lt;String, Int&gt; = HashMap(readWriteMap)
</code></pre>
