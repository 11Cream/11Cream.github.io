        Development</h1>
    <p>Kotlin is a great fit for developing Android applications, bringing all of the
        advantages of a modern language
        to the Android platform without introducing any new restrictions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Compatibility</strong>: Kotlin is fully compatible with JDK 6,
            ensuring that Kotlin applications can run on older
            Android devices with no issues. The Kotlin tooling is fully supported in
            Android Studio and compatible with the Android build system.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Performance</strong>: A Kotlin application runs as fast as an
            equivalent Java one, thanks to very similar bytecode structure.
            With Kotlin's support for inline functions, code using lambdas often runs
            even faster than the same code written in Java.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Interoperability</strong>: Kotlin is 100% interoperable with Java,
            allowing to use all existing Android libraries
            in a Kotlin application. This includes annotation processing, so databinding
            and Dagger work too.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Footprint</strong>: Kotlin has a very compact runtime library, which
            can be further reduced through the use of ProGuard.
            In a
            <b style="color:blue;">real
                application</b>, the Kotlin runtime adds
            only a few hundred methods and less than 100K to the size of the .apk file.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Compilation Time</strong>: Kotlin supports efficient incremental
            compilation, so while there's some additional overhead
            for clean builds, <b style="color:blue;">incremental
                builds are usually as fast or faster than with Java</b>.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Learning Curve</strong>: For a Java developer, getting started with
            Kotlin is very easy. The automated Java to Kotlin converter included in the
            Kotlin plugin
            helps with the first steps. <b style="color:blue;">Kotlin
                Koans</b> offer a guide through the key features of the language with a
            series of interactive exercises.
