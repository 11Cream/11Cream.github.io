    <h1 id="main_title">Using Kotlin for Server-side Development</h1>
    <p>Kotlin is a great fit for developing server-side applications, allowing to write concise and
        expressive code while maintaining full compatibility with existing Java-based technology
        stacks and a smooth learning curve:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Expressiveness</strong>: Kotlin's innovative language features, such
            as its support for <b style="color:blue;">type-safe builders</b>
            and <b style="color:blue;">delegated properties</b>, help build
            powerful and easy-to-use abstractions.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Kotlin's support for <b style="color:blue;">coroutines</b>
            helps build server-side
            applications
            that scale to massive numbers of clients with modest hardware requirements.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Interoperability</strong>: Kotlin is fully compatible with all
            Java-based frameworks, which lets you stay on your
            familiar technology stack while reaping the benefits of a more modern
            language.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Migration</strong>: Kotlin supports gradual, step by step migration
            of large codebases from Java to Kotlin. You can start
            writing new code in Kotlin while keeping older parts of your system in Java.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Tooling</strong>: In addition to great IDE support in general,
            Kotlin offers framework-specific tooling (for example,
            for Spring) in the plugin for IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Learning Curve</strong>: For a Java developer, getting started with
            Kotlin is very easy. The automated Java to Kotlin converter included in the
            Kotlin plugin
            Â  helps with the first steps. <b style="color:blue;">Kotlin
                Koans</b> offer a guide through the key features of the language with a
            series of interactive exercises.
