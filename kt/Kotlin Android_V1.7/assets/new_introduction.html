    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>When we are talking about Android development, immediately language that comes to our mind
        is:<strong>Java</strong></p>
    <p>Almost all the android apps are written in Java only, <b>Do you think Java is the only
        option?</b>
    </p>
    <p>Answer is <strong>No</strong>,You can write Android apps in any language that can compile and
        run on the Java Virtual
        Machine (JVM). And one JVM-compatible programming language thatâ€™s really caught
        the attention of the Android community is<strong style="color:red;"> Kotlin</strong>, a
        <mark><em>statically typed programming language</em></mark>
        from <strong>JetBrains</strong>.
    </p>

    <p><b style="color:red;">Note:</b>In <b>Google I/O 2017</b>, Google has announced that
        <b>Kotlin</b> is the
        another official language for <b>Android Developemnt</b>.
        <br>
        <mark><b>Kotlin</b> is not the replacement of Java or it will not replace java. Java and
            Kotlin will work together.
        </mark>
        <br>
        <b style="color:blue;">Kotlin + Java = Powerful Java</b>
    </p>

    <h3>What is Kotlin?</h3>
    <p>1) Kotlin is a <strong style="color:red;">statically-typed language</strong>, developed by
        <strong>JetBrains</strong>,
        that runs on the Java virtual machine and also compiled to JavaScript source code.</p>
    <p>whose syntax is more expressive and concise than that of Java. With features like<strong>
        higher-order functions, lambda expressions,
        operator overloading, string templates,</strong> and more</p>
    <p>Kotlin has a lot more to offer than Java. Because Java and Kotlin are highly<strong>
        interoperable</strong>,
        they can be used together in the same project.</p>

    <h4>What is Statically- typed language?</h4>
    <p><b>Dynamically typed programming language </b>do type checking at the <b>run-time </b>as
        opposed to compile-time.
        A programming language is said to use <b>static typing </b>when type checking is performed
        during <b>compile-time </b>as
        opposed to run-time. In static typing types are associated with <b>variable</b> not <b>values.</b>
