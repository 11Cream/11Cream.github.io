    <h2>Java Vs Kotlin</h2>
    <p>The reason they decided to come up with a new “spinning wheel” for Android development is
        quite easy to
        understand; apparently, there are a few:</p>
    <p><b>1. Java has been around for 22 years already,
        which is why there are loads of features that can not be implemented due to Java's
        massiveness and obsolescence.</b></p>
    <p><b>2. Java requires long code combinations to be written.</b></p>
    <p><b>3. Code written on Java takes quite a while to compile.</b></p>

    <h3>Reasons to Use Kotlin:</h3>
    <h4>1) Kotlin requires less code to write.</h4>
    <p>At least 20% less. 22-year old Java is a bit outdated with every update it becomes harder to
        include some new features;
        consequently, the amount of code to write also increases. On the contrary, Kotlin’s
        architecture was created from scratch,
        causing the absence of layer to layer architecture.</p>
    <h4>2) Less crushes occur on Kotlin.</h4>
    <p>Kotlin JVM has much fewer issues as the often called<strong> “one billion dollar mistake”
        - </strong>
        the issue of<strong style="color:red;"> NullPointerExeption </strong>is preventable there.
        NullPointer is yet present in every programming
        language, but the ways of working with it may differ.</p>

    <h4> 3) Kotlin is a type-safety language.</h4>

    <p>Again, in Kotlin every class is a function, and vice versa; more to this, same as Swift for
        iOS, Kotlin for
        Android has Optional types, which help with all the safety checkups.</p>


    <h4> 4) Kotlin saves you some of your precious time.</h4>

    <p>As it was already said, less code almost guarantees less bugs and, respectively, less time is
        tracked on the whole coding process. And quite often software development teams calculate
        the total
        costs of the project according to the amount of hours developers spend on coding.</p>
