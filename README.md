### Looking For 
	
    Kubernetes and New technology adopting culture where I can explore my knowledge and skills. I  wanted to be part of something amazing in Techworld.

### Bio

CKA | Istio | Helm | Linux | AWS | GitOps | Jenkins | CI/CD | Ansible | Terraform | Automation | Scripting | I can build low latency, HA, fault-tolerant, Secure, Robust, Auto Scalable Infrastructure

### Intro

I am Darshan Mistry, A DevOps Engineer.
I am the Certified Kubernetes Administrator by Cloud Native Computing Foundation(CNCF) and Certified DevOps Professional by IBM.
I am owning an experience with 5 DevOps teams.
I worked with complex 97+ microservices deployed over Kubernetes base containerize Infrastructure.
Istio mash is implemented on the Kubernetes cluster.
To reduce the cost of infrastructure and make it highly resilient are my abilities.
I can automate the deployment process with CI/CD using Jenkins and GitHub actions.
I have an idea about an Agile software build life cycle.
I can make the software deployment lifecycle smoother and faster using CI/CD pipelines.
I can build, secure, and High Available Infrastructure using a different load balancer and reverse proxies in AWS.
I can build infrastructure in Terraform.
It will help to make quick changes in infrastructure.
And the code in terraforms is used to create disaster recovery planes.
I am using ansible to keep updating new packages on a number of servers in a short time.
I can automate the simple task using a Shell script, or a Python script.
I can deploy a Prometheus, Grafana, datalog, and ELK stack over Kubernetes.
